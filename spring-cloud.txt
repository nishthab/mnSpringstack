Spring Boot / Cloud Update

Spring Boot and Spring Cloud are very active projects from Pivotal
It is released quite frequently
We would like all of us to benefit from those updates
However, we would still like to keep the base 1.4.1 version unchanged for some time
That is why this is the new repository we have created to use that for making updates avoiding to break the primary one
Clone this https://github.com/rollingstonetechnology/udemy-rsmortgage-eureka-service-discovery-ha-latest
And follow all the other instructions unchanged
What changed
Spring Boot version from 1.4.1 to 1.5.2
Spring Cloud version from Camden.SR6 to Dalston.SR1
Rest everything else we learned about service discovery remains unchanged.
